# Fact Graph

## What is the Fact Graph?

The Fact Graph is a production-ready knowledge graph for modeling, among other things, the United States Internal Revenue Code and related tax law forked from the IRS.
It can be used in JavaScript as well as any JVM language (Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, etc.).

## Useful documentation
* [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) - the testing framework we use
* [scala-xml](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.19/scala-xml/scala/xml/) - the standard implementation of XML (don't be put off by the sparse-seeming API docs, the function definitions have very good examples)
